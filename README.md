Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a detailed README.md documentation for the source files you currently have opened:

## SliderAndCheckbox

SliderAndCheckbox is a Flutter package that provides a customizable slider with checkboxes. It allows you to display a list of images with optional checkboxes. You can customize the appearance, animation, and behavior of the slider and checkboxes.

## Features

- Display a list of images with optional checkboxes
- Customize the appearance of the slider and checkboxes
- Customize the animation of the images and checkboxes
- Customize the behavior of the slider and checkboxes
- Support for overlay text on the images
- Support for auto-scrolling of the images
- Support for swipe gestures to navigate between images
- Support for tapping on images to view details
- Support for tapping on checkboxes to toggle their state

## Getting Started

To use SliderAndCheckbox in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  slider_and_checkbox: ^1.0.0
```

2. Import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:slider_and_checkbox/slider_and_checkbox.dart';
```

3. Create a list of `ImageModel` objects representing the images you want to display:

```dart
List<ImageModel> images = [
  ImageModel(imageUrl: 'image1.jpg', title: 'Image 1', subtitle: 'Subtitle 1'),
  ImageModel(imageUrl: 'image2.jpg', title: 'Image 2', subtitle: 'Subtitle 2'),
  ImageModel(imageUrl: 'image3.jpg', title: 'Image 3', subtitle: 'Subtitle 3'),
];
```

4. Add the `SliderAndCheckbox` widget to your widget tree:

```dart
SliderAndCheckbox(
  images: images,
)
```

## Usage

Here's an example usage of the `SliderAndCheckbox` widget:

```dart
SliderAndCheckbox(
  images: images,
  animationDuration: Duration(seconds: 1),
  imageBorderRadius: 16,
  overlayTextColor: Colors.white,
  overlayTextSize: 16,
  overlayTextWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  showOverlayText: true,
  autoScroll: true,
  isOverlaySlider: true,
  imageAnimationType: AnimateEaseType.easeInOut,
  titleAnimationType: AnimateEaseType.easeInOut,
  subTitleAnimationType: AnimateEaseType.easeInOut,
  onCheckboxChanged: (index, checked) {
    // Handle checkbox change event
  },
)
```

In this example, we customize the appearance and behavior of the slider and checkboxes. We set the animation duration to 1 second, the image border radius to 16 pixels, and enable overlay text on the images. We also enable auto-scrolling of the images and use an overlay slider.

We also provide a callback function `onCheckboxChanged` to handle the checkbox change event.

Note: This is a basic example. You can customize the appearance, animation, and behavior of the slider and checkboxes further by exploring the available properties and methods of the `SliderAndCheckbox` widget.
